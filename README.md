## 🧰 Installation

1. Download the `.paf.exe` installer.
2. Run it and choose your PortableApps root directory (e.g. `X:\PortableApps\`).
3. Launch Brave Portable from the PortableApps.com menu or directly via:

```
X:\PortableApps\BravePortable\BravePortable.exe
```

To update, just download and install the new version over the old one — your data is preserved, but taking a backup beforehand is always recommended.
Brave browser may clear up all your data if a program on your PC tries to install a browser extension by itself (for example, IDM). Regular backups of the Data folder are recommended.
